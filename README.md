# GestureGlide-AI
GestureGlide is a real-time artificial intelligence system designed to enhance human-computer interaction through gesture, emotion, and air-written math recognition. 
GestureGlide-AI is a real-time computer vision application designed to interpret human hand gestures for various purposes, including sign language detection, emotion recognition, and air-written mathematical expression understanding. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system processes live video input to provide accurate and responsive interpretations.

Features
Sign Language Detection: Recognizes and interprets sign language gestures to facilitate communication.

Emotion Recognition: Analyzes facial expressions and gestures to determine the user's emotional state.

Air-Written Math Interpretation: Understands mathematical expressions written in the air using hand gestures.

Real-Time Processing: Processes live video feeds to provide immediate feedback and interpretations.
